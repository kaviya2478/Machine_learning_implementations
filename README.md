Regression:

Regression is a type of Supervised Learning,where we provide the algorithm with the true value of each data during the training process. After that, we can use the trained model to predict a numeric value,whether it's a price that you should pay  to buy a new house, people's weight and height , birth rate, etc.


Linear Regression:

Linear Regression is a Supervised Learning algorithm which is generally used when the valuexto be predicted is of discrete or quantitative nature.
It tries to establish a realtionship between the dependent variable 'y' and one or more related independent varaibles 'x' using what is referred to as the best-fit line.

TYPES:

Simple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regrssion:

The crux of Simple Linear Regression is to derive a best-fit line that captures the relationship between any single independent variable and the dependent variable.

The best-fit line emphasizes minimizing the overall distance of data points from the regression line, ensuring a precise alignment with the trend.

y=mx+c

m-slope
c-intercept
